[] Application has package.json
[] server.js requires express and body-parser.
[] db folder has files "schema.sql" and "seed.sql"
[] db has this structure:
   ()`burgers` table with these fields:
     {} **id**: an auto incrementing int that serves as the primary key.
     {}**burger_name**: a string.
     {} **devoured**: a boolean.
[] seeds.sql has at least three entries
[] connection.js connects Node to MySQL.
[] connection.js exports the connection.
[] `orm.js` requires `connection.js`
[] orm.js contains an object that provides these methods to execute MySQL commands in the controllers to  retrieve and store data in the db:
     ()`selectAll()`
